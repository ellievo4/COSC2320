The dog went here and there 
And the sun spun round like a top 
This is a fake 
But the nearest kin of the star
The creeping cat looked up
Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon
seven
For wander and wail as he would
The pure cold light in the sky
Troubled his animal blood
Minnaloushe runs in the grass
Lifting his delicate feet
